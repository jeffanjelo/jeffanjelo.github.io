    <h1> Netflix My Number 1 Place to Relax and Goof Off </h1>
    <p>For those who do not know what <em><strong> Netflix </strong></em> is, it is a movie/tv show streaming site. Heres the link if you want 
        <a href='https://www.netflix.com/signup' title='Netflix SignUp'> sign up </a>. Netflix is always adding new series and movies for its customers to binge watch.</p>
    <p>The current show I am binge watching is the tv show called <strong> Lucifer. </strong> This is show about the devil leaving hell and solving crime in the city of Los Angeles.</p>

    <p> Also since I like <em> <strong> League of Legends </strong></em> I have been watching <strong> Arcane. </strong>It is a story based on two sides of the same town being at odds with each other.</p>
